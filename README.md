# MarcDuinoV4

## What is the MarcDuino system?
(from https://www.curiousmarc.com/r2-d2/marcduino-system):

"The MarcDuino system controls the animatronics of an R2 (dome panels, light and sound). It currently controls 10 dome panels, an "MP3 Trigger" sound board, dome "Teeces" lights and holoprojectors light and movements, and I2C gizmos you can add-in yourself. It has lots of pre-programmed effects making all these act together.

The system is centered around the MarcDuino boards which sit in the R2. There are two kinds, the Master and the Slave board, which are very similar to each other." - CuriousMarc

MarcDuinoV4 has nothing to do with the original firmware made by Marc nor with the spinoff made by Neil! So if you have any questions to MarcDuinoV4 don't ask any of them, but contact me (RealNobser) here on GitHub.
