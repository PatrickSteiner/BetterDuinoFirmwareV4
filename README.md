# MarcDuinoV4

The MarcDuino system controls the animatronics of an R2 (dome panels, light and sound) from an iPhone. It currently controls 10 dome panels, an "MP3 Trigger" sound board, dome "Teeces" lights and holoprojectors light and movements, and I2C gizmos you can add-in yourself. It has lots of pre-programmed effects making all these act together. Here is the info on how it works, how to build or order the parts, and customize it to your liking.

Demo of the MarcDuino system

The system is centered around the MarcDuino boards which sit in the R2. There are two kinds, the Master and the Slave board, which are very similar to each other - they mostly differ by the firmware that runs on them. The two videos below explain what each board does, you should watch them to understand how the system works. Note that the videos feature the "v2" boards, but I now recommend the "v1.5" boards (newer despite the strange numbering) which are currently available and functionally equivalent.
